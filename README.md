# Multi-Step Form Web App

> Welcome to my interactive multi-step form web application — a clean, intuitive, and fully responsive subscription flow built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



##  Features

### Multi-Step Navigation
Move through 4 guided steps with clear forward and back navigation. The sidebar highlights your current step at all times so you always know where you are in the flow.

### Form Validation
Step 1 includes real-time validation — empty fields are flagged with red borders and inline error messages before allowing you to proceed.

### Plan Selection
Step 2 lets you pick from three subscription tiers and toggle between **monthly** and **yearly** billing. Yearly pricing is automatically calculated (10x the monthly rate), and the toggle visually reflects your active choice.

### Dynamic Add-ons
Step 3 offers three optional add-ons. Each can be toggled on/off with a styled checkbox. Selected add-ons persist and are reflected in the final summary.

### Live Order Summary
Step 4 dynamically builds your order summary — pulling in your selected plan, billing cycle, and any checked add-ons — and calculates the total in real time.

### Fully Responsive
The layout adapts for both desktop and mobile. On smaller screens, the sidebar collapses to a top-fixed progress indicator and the navigation buttons anchor to the bottom of the viewport.
